Password Manager Description:

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a secure password manager that allows users to store, organize, and retrieve their passwords safely.

Encryption: User passwords are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES encryption) before being stored in the password manager's database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure.

Storage: The password manager securely stores user passwords in a centralized database or file, protecting them from unauthorized access.

Password Generation: The password manager provides a feature for generating strong, random passwords with customizable parameters such as length, complexity, and allowed characters. This encourages users to use unique and secure passwords for each account.

Organization: Users can organize their passwords into categories or folders for easy management and retrieval. Common categories may include social media accounts, email accounts, banking, etc.

User Authentication: To access the password manager, users must authenticate themselves using a master password or other secure authentication methods such as biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition).

Password Retrieval: Users can retrieve their stored passwords securely using the password manager's interface. The manager decrypts the passwords on-the-fly and presents them to the user, minimizing the risk of exposure.

Password Strength Analysis: The password manager may include a feature to analyze the strength of existing passwords and provide recommendations for improving weak passwords.

Backup and Synchronization: Users have the option to back up their password database securely and synchronize it across multiple devices. This ensures accessibility and data integrity in case of device loss or failure.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The password manager is designed to be compatible with various operating systems and platforms, including desktop computers, mobile devices, and web browsers.

Security Measures: In addition to encryption, the password manager implements other security measures such as secure key storage, password hashing, and protection against common security threats like brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.
